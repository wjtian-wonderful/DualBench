## Usage ðŸš‚

1. DualBench test set:
   The `video-to-soundtrack.jsonl` file is the test set for the video-to-soundtrack task. Each entry in the JSONL file contains the following keys:

   - `id`: A unique identifier for the entry.

   - `audiopath`: The file path to the corresponding audio file.

   - `speech`: The transcribed speech content, if available.

   - `videopath`: The file path to the corresponding video file.


â€‹	This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the model in generating soundtracks for videos.

â€‹	samples:

```json

```



2. Training code: 

```bash
cd CASP
bash train.sh
```

3. Inference code: 

```bash
cd CASP
python inference_score_v2c_bench_gt.py
```
